# Welcome to TestMonitor on GitHub 👋

TestMonitor is a complete test management platform for designing, planning, and managing manual and automated software testing — all in one place.

We believe in the power of community and open collaboration. While our core application — [TestMonitor](https://www.testmonitor.com) — is a commercial SaaS product, we actively support and contribute to the open source ecosystem.

## 💡 Why We’re Here

At TestMonitor, we use a wide variety of open source tools in our daily development workflows. As a way to give back, we share some of our internal tooling, utilities, and integrations that others may find helpful.

This GitHub organization hosts:

- 📦 Laravel and PHP packages used in or inspired by our main application
- 🔌 API client wrappers for integrations with tools like ClickUp, Azure DevOps, and Jira
- 🛠️ Supporting libraries and utilities that help streamline development or testing workflows

All repositories are maintained by our engineering team and are released under permissive open source licenses unless otherwise noted.
