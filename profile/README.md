# Welcome to TestMonitor on GitHub 👋

TestMonitor is an end-to-end test management platform that helps teams plan, design, and manage both automated and manual software testing with ease.

We believe in the power of community and open collaboration. While our core application — [TestMonitor](https://www.testmonitor.com) — is a commercial SaaS product, we actively support and contribute to the open source ecosystem.

## 💡 Why We’re Here

At TestMonitor, we use a wide variety of open source tools in our daily development workflows. As a way to give back, we share some of our internal tooling, utilities, and integrations that others may find helpful.

This GitHub organization hosts:

- 🧰 Laravel and PHP packages
- 🧪 Testing integrations and CLI tools
- 📦 Libraries and SDKs used in or alongside TestMonitor

All repositories are maintained by our engineering team and are released under permissive open source licenses unless otherwise noted.
