# Security Policy

This policy applies to public repositories under the [TestMonitor organization][gh-organization] on GitHub.

For vulnerabilities affecting the TestMonitor platform or hosted services, please refer to our [Vulnerability Disclosure Program][vulnerability-disclosure] for full scope, expectations, and reporting instructions.

## Bug Fix and Security Support

We follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Security and critical bug fixes are generally provided for the latest minor release only (X.Y.Z, where Y is the minor version).

- Fixes that include new features are released in the next minor version.
- Urgent or high-severity vulnerabilities may trigger an immediate patch (Z increment).
- Major version bumps are reserved for breaking changes required by a fix.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure and appreciate your help in keeping our projects secure.

### How to report

The **preferred method** is to use the **"Report a vulnerability"** button on the repository’s **Security** tab. This opens a private, secure thread with the maintainers.

If GitHub’s reporting workflow is unavailable or not appropriate for your situation, please email our team directly at [support@testmonitor.com](mailto:support@testmonitor.com).
